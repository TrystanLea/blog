## title: What might a Zero Carbon Wales look like?
### published: 2022-9-07

**Early draft, work still in progress**

The following scenario for Wales is a scaled down version of the Zero Carbon Britain scenario (on a per household basis).

Modelled using the ZeroCarbonBritain hourly energy model: [https://openenergymonitor.org/zcem](https://openenergymonitor.org/zcem).

Based on 1.38 million households (Enter in 'Scaled to' section).

Current energy consumption and generation data from Regen reports:

- Energy Generation in Wales 2020 (Published May 2022)
- Energy Use in Wales Second Edition (Published May 2022)

**Demand Summary**

|    | Current | ZCB |
|----|----|----|
| Lighting, Appliances, Cooking & Other | 9.2 TWh/yr | 5.6 TWh/yr (More efficient appliances) |
| Space and Water heat, fuel demand | 25.5 TWh/yr | 6.4 TWh/yr (Retrofit & heat pumps) |
| Transport demand | 23.5 TWh/yr | 7.8 TWh/yr (Electrification & modal shifts) |
| Industry demand | 34.6 TWh/yr | 14.3 TWh/yr (Industry in Wales proportionally larger [1]) |
| Electricity % of demand | 16% | 73% |
| Total demand | 92.8 TWh/yr | 34.1 TWh/yr |
| Total CO2e emissions | 38.7 MtCO2e | < 0 MtCO2e |
| **Key progress metrics** |    |    | 
| % of heating electrified with heat pumps | ~0.7% [2] | 90% |
| % of transport electrified | 0.9% [3] | 90% |

1\. Pembroke refinery dominates industrial energy use in Wales, followed by steel works in Port Talbot. The ZeroCarbonBritain scenario uses no fossil fuels for energy and so associated refinery energy use should decrease to zero. Some energy will still be required however if the refinery is used for plastic production. Fossil fuel refinery energy use is replaced to some degree by energy use in the production of green hydrogen, and power to gas processes. To be updated with comparison of numbers.<br><br>
2\. Heat from heat pumps 104 MW (173 GWh), target for 3% electrification of heat by 2025.<br>
3\. 14,600 EV's 2021 (9100 BEV's, 5500 PHEV), 27 GWh electric demand.

4\. Current biomass for biogas estimated from current use of AD for 19 MW elec (100 GWh) & 8 MW heat (49 GWh). (100รท0.3)+(49รท0.8) = 395 GWh. Energy from waste (136 GWh), sewage gas (44 GWh) and landfill gas (83 GWh) is added to this to give 658 GWh.

5\. The use of gas in gas turbines needs to reduce 95% and the remaining 5% needs to be synthetic methane not fossil fuel derived.

**How far are we on the path to a zero carbon future?**

We have so far built enough renewable energy to provide just over 20% of the energy required for our portion of the ZeroCarbonBritain energy scenario demand. We have added about 8 TWh of renewable electricity in the 14 years from 2006 to 2020. An average rate of increase of 0.571 TWh/year. At this rate it will take 67.5 years to reach the amount of renewable energy suggested in this scenario. This would give a net zero date of ~2087. To reach net zero by 2050 we would need to increase deployment rates to 1.28 TWh/year, 2.25x the average rate over the last 14 years. The following section explores new projects currently in various stages of development, these would if they are all developed meet this deployment rate putting us on track for 2050, assuming a further set of projects are developed following these.

**New wind and solar projects**

Total offshore wind: 4.6 GW (17.9 TWh) by 2035 = 1.2 TWh/year.

The 2020 Energy Generation in Wales report suggests that there are over 20 onshore wind projects with capacities greater than 1 MW. I have been able to identify 12 projects so far with a potential for 0.8 GW of capacity and 2.1 TWh/yr of generation, all at various stages of conceptual design, public consultation and planning. There will also likely be significant growth in solar both in terms of solar farms and roof mounted systems.

While floating offshore wind maybe considered an early pilot stage technology, the world first floating offshore wind farm; Hywind in Scotland is out-performing all other wind farms in the UK: https://www.evwind.es/2021/03/23/hywind-scotland-remains-the-uks-best-performing-offshore-wind-farm/79952.

The above floating, fixed and onshore wind projects could deliver an additional 20 TWh/year of generation or an average annual increase in generation of ~1.3 TWh/year for the 2020 to 2035 period, putting us on a trajectory for the 2050 net zero date but we would need to build another round of projects of a similar scale in the period from 2035-2050 to ultimately meet the target.

**Other technologies**

There is work being done to developing tidal and wave energy in Wales. These projects are in the early development / pilot stage but could deliver significant energy in future (numbers needed). E.g: https://www.marineenergywales.co.uk & https://www.morlaisenergy.com or https://www.northwalestidalenergy.com/energy-generation which proposes a 2-2.5GW scheme that could generate 4.0 TWh/yr. 

There is also potential for new nuclear at Trawsfynydd (440 MW, 3.5 TWh/yr, E.g: https://gov.wales/written-statement-cwmni-egino-trawsfynydd) and Wylfa (~1GW, 7.9 TWh/yr, e.g:https://www.newcivilengineer.com/latest/wylfa-bradwell-and-oldbury-among-18-sites-lined-up-for-small-nuclear-reactors-30-09-2021/).

If all of the projects identified above were developed we would reach 45.44 TWh/yr of generation, this would be enough to reach 93% of the generation target outlined above.
