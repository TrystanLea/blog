In September 2017, my partner Claire and I bought a mid-terrace house near Llanberis in North Wales.

This blog documents the process of exploring what we could do to bring the house a little bit closer to the standards and technology mix outlined in the ZeroCarbonBritain scenario for a sustainable energy future.

Here’s a picture of the house (we’re the blue one!) nestled on the edge of a particularly wild corner of Snowdonia.

**The house:**

- 3 bedroom mid-terrace
- South facing with large south facing window.
- Uninsulated stone construction, double glazing, ~200mm loft insulation
- Original heating system when we moved in was a multi-fuel stove with a back boiler, electric room heaters and an electric shower.

In early January 2019 we installed an Air-source heat pump which has been working really well. Most of the posts in this blog series cover a mix of energy assessment, heat pump design and performance monitoring.
