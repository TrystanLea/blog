## title: What might a Zero Carbon Britain look like?
### published: 2022-9-07

**Early draft, work still in progress**

The following pages try to explore zero carbon scenarios at different scales. Starting with Britain as a whole and then zooming in to Wales, Gwynedd and ending with Llanberis. I have tried to keep the following as focused on the numbers as possible, minimising my own interpretation. I might come back to add that in later or add it as a seperate piece.

### ZeroCarbonBritain

**A breif outline of the scenario**<br>
The ZeroCarbonBritain scenario is a 100% Renewable energy scenario for the UK. In material terms it describes a modern way of living that is not that different to how we live today. It is more ambitious than many scenarios on reducing demand, building energy use is reduced by 67% through state of the art insulation and air-tightness techniques, efficient appliances, led lighting and the electrification of heat with heat pumps. Transport energy is reduced 76% through a combination of electrification, modal shifts and a particularly ambitious reduction in aviation. On the supply side, offshore wind provides the largest portion of energy supply.

Number of households: 29.0 million (2030).

**Demand Summary**

|    | Current | ZCB |
|----|----|----|
| Lighting, Appliances and Cooking | 199 TWh/yr | 112 TWh/yr (More efficient appliances) |
| Space and Water heat, fuel demand | 536 TWh/yr | 129 TWh/yr (Retrofit & heat pumps*) |
| Transport demand | 661 TWh/yr | 157 TWh/yr (Electrification & modal shifts) |
| Industry demand | 229 TWh/yr | 288 TWh/yr (Onshoring and economic growth) |
| **Key progress metrics** |    |    | 
| % of heating electrified with heat pumps | ? | 90% |
| % of transport electrified | ? | 90% |

*Heat pumps move 136 TWh/yr of heat from outside air into buildings. Total delivered heat is 129 TWh/yr + 136 TWh/yr = 265 TWh/yr.

**Supply Summary**

Latest offshore and onshore wind capacities from: https://www.renewableuk.com/page/UKWEDhome

Latest solar capacity sum of 13,800 MW end of 2021 + 556 MW first 6 months of 2022.

Many of the other figures are based on data from 2018 national statistics.
