## Embodied Energy

### Offshore Wind: 15.1 TWh/yr

A Vestas V90 3.0 MW turbine sited in good location can achieve a capacity factor of 54.16%, generating 14,230 MWh/year (Horns Reef in Denmark). The LCA study gives the embodied energy per turbine as 8,098 MWh, which means the energy payback happens in 0.57 years or 6.8 months. The embodied energy per GW/MW/kW installed is therefore 2700 GWh/MWh/kWh respectively. The LCA suggests turbine lifetimes of between 20 & 30 years is possible.

The ZeroCarbonBritain scenario includes 140 GW of offshore wind capacity. At 2700 GWh per GW this would require 378,000 GWh of energy to build - or if expended evenly over a fleet lifetime of 25 years with a portion in continuous replacement: 15,120 GWh/year. This is equivalent to 5.3% of ZeroCarbonBritain's projected industry energy demand of 287 TWh/year.

ZeroCarbonBritain projects a rapid build out of zero carbon supply capacity. If 140 GW of offshore wind where built over a 10 year period, the energy demand for turbine production would be equivalent to 13.2% of ZCB industrial demand.

### Onshore Wind: 1.7 TWh/yr

A Vestas V90 3.0 MW turbine sited in good location can achieve a capacity factor of 30%, generating 7,890 MWh/year (realistic site placement in Denmark). The LCA study gives the embodied energy per turbine as 4,304 MWh, which means the energy payback happens in 0.55 years or 6.6 months. The embodied energy per GW/MW/kW installed is therefore 1435 GWh/MWh/kWh respectively. The LCA suggests turbine lifetimes of between 20 & 30 years is possible.

The ZeroCarbonBritain scenario includes 30 GW of onshore wind capacity. At 1435 GWh per GW this would require 43,050 GWh of energy to build - or if expended evenly over a fleet lifetime of 25 years with a portion in continuous replacement: 1,722 GWh/year. This is equivalent to 0.6% of ZeroCarbonBritain's projected industry energy demand.

- 6.2t Iron per turbine
- 2.1t Zinc per turbine
- 1.9t Manganese per turbine
- 0.53t Copper per turbine

### Solar PV: 5.0 TWh/yr

Page 35 of the Fraunhofer Solar PV report includes a chart showing the Energy Pay-Back Time of Rooftop PV Systems including mounting and inverters located in Germany. EPBT time varies from ~1.2 years for CdTe technology to 3.4 years for Mono-Si. The EPBT has improved over time due to increased manufacturing efficiency so we might expect the average EPBT to improve further.

It is also worth noting that EPBT is the primary energy equivalent payback and is currently calculated based on LCA's with energy systems that inculde a mix of thermal generation. A solar PV panel manufactured on a zero carbon renewable energy supply including mining and basic material processing would likely impact on this calculation. As an example the 2015 IEA-PVPS report suggests that the EPBT for single-crystalline silicon could reduce from 2.4 years today to 1.2 in future (page 8) [6].

In the ZeroCarbonBritain scenario 1 kWp of Solar PV generates about 840 kWh/year. If the EPBT is 2.0 the embodied energy would be about 1680 kWh/kWp (non-primary?). It's not that clear what the electricity and synth fuel requirements would be per kWp of solar PV production in a ZeroCarbonBritain like scenario, more research required.

The ZeroCarbonBritain scenario includes 90 GW of solar PV capacity. At 1680 GWh per GW this would require 151,200 GWh of energy to manufacture - or if expended evenly over a lifetime of 30 years with a portion in continuous replacement: 5,040 GWh/year. This is equivalent to 1.8% of ZeroCarbonBritain's projected industry energy demand.

### Lithium ion batteries

The paper 'Hydrogen or batteries for grid storage? A net energy analysis' gives the electrical embodied energy of lithium ion batteries to be 136 kWh per kWh. The paper also quotes a cycle life of 6000 cycles at 80% DOD which seems a bit optimistic.. but also does not specify degradation extent e.g x number of cycles to 70% capacity.

The paper 'The Underestimated Potential of Battery Electric Vehicles to Reduce Emissions' by Auke Hoekstra suggests that the GHG emissions of lithium ion battery production is 65 kg GHG per kWh of battery produced.

### Hydrogen Electrolysis

378 kWh primary per kW of fuel cell. The paper estimates the electrical energy equivalent embodied energy as 378 kWh x 30% = 114 kWh per kW. The paper states that this assumption necessarily introduces significant uncertainty and they therefore examine a wide range in their sensitivity analysis.
