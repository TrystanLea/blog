See previous years for more detailed discussion.

### Heat pump performance overview

- Annual space heating COP average: 4.27
- Annual domestic hot water COP: 4.01
- Standby electricity consumption: 78 kWh
- Combined space heating and DHW COP (not including standby): 4.19
- Combined space heating, water heating and standby COP: 4.06
- 4% lower electricity consumption than 2022 but mostly a very similar year.

Annual heating electricity consumption and heat output comparison of all years:

The last three years have been quite similar, reflecting higher comfort levels and higher hot water use based on now being a family of four.


### Heating cost

- **Based on time of use Octopus GO cost of heating (32 p/kWh):**<br>Increased by 40% from £515 in 2022 to £725 in 2023, delivered heat unit rate of 7.92 p/kWh.

- **Based on average unit rate for all electric (23 p/kWh):**<br>The cost of heating increased by 30% from £394 in 2022 to £518 in 2023, delivered heat unit rate of 5.7 p/kWh.

Our EV charged solely overnight during the cheap Octopus GO tariff rate effectively lowers the average unit cost paid for all electricity consumption.
